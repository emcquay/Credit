# Credit

This gets the user to input a credit card number and, using luhns algorithm, determines if the card is a valid credit card and what type of card it is. 
We were given specific constraints for the starting digits and total digits used by Mastercard, VISA and AMEX cards so that also needed to be taken into consideration.
If a single criteria was not met the program should print "INVALID\n".
